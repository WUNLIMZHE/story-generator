# Story Generator Application

About this application
-------------------------------------------------------
Developed a web application that integrates with the Gemini API, specifically utilizing Google's Generative AI service, to generate stories based on user preferences with advanced filtering capabilities. The generated story is then processed using the OpenAI Text-to-Speech API, converting it into an audio format that narrates the story.
